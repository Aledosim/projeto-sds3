# DS Vendas

This is a web site developed during a event of DevSuperior, called Semana Spring React (Spring React Week). You can check out the live site here.

## The event

This was an third edition of online event carried by DevSuperior that went during may third and 9th of 2021. The objective was to teach some of the technologies that tech companies search for. The propose was to develop and deploy a website that shows fake information about sellers and sales, with graphics and tables constructed with information of the back end server.
Was supplied some step by step material along with videos and a Discord community for questions.

## Technologies used

The front end was developed with ReactJS, using Axios to communicate with the back end. ApexCharts was used to make the graphs and the styling was made with Bootstrap. The navigation is based on React Router and everything is in Typescript. The deployment is at Netlify
The back end is based on Spring Boot. H2 Database Engine was used during the development and PostgreSQL in production. The tests were made with Postman. The server relies on Heroku.

## Lessons

Since there was too much software that I don't know if I'll keep daily usage, I decided to carry this course into a VM with antiX installed. I had a problem with Java (which is not my main language) with typing. Had a problem with pgAdmin too, which I could not use because I canceled the configuration script execution and could not fix it. So I used psql commands (I like the terminal anyway).
For me was a great way to introduce myself into Spring framework. I've been using ReactJS for some months now, although I've never used Axios and never made great beautiful graphics.
I think the deployment process and the back end architecture is my greatest learned lesson.
